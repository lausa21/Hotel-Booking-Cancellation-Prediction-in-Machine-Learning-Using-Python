# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction-in-Machine-Learning-Using-Python
This project, developed for a 4th-semester Model Deployment course, focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations. As a data scientist, the objective is to build, evaluate, and deploy a machine learning model that classifies whether a booking will be canceled or not based on a variety of booking attributes.
