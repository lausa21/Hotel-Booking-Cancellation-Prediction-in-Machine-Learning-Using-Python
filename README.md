# üè® Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction
This project, developed for a 4th-semester Model Deployment course, focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations. As a data scientist, the objective is to build, evaluate, and deploy a machine learning model that classifies whether a booking will be canceled or not based on a variety of booking attributes.

The project involves a complete machine learning lifecycle, including:
* Data preprocessing
* A comparative analysis of two powerful algorithms (**Random Forest** and **XGBoost**)
* Refactoring the training pipeline into an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structure
* Deploying the final model as an interactive web application using **Streamlit** **[Click Here](https://2702213770laurelevelinawidjajautsmodeldeploymentigdvvkotra9hk.streamlit.app/)**
